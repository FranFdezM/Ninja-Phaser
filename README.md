Hey there!
This is a test web videogame made with Phaser 3, a JavaScript framework dedicated to game development. 
Using some assets I designed and others that are free, Iâ€™ve created a "Super Mario"-style game featuring random level generation based on three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, and Hard).
Feel free to give me constructive feedback to improve this project, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.
